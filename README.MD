Regardless of if you have submitted your project via Workspace, an uploaded zip folder, or git repository, a README is required.

Your README must contain:

The scripts needed to test/start/build your application
Any endpoints that should be accessed to test that you have created the required functionality.
Any other functionality you have included in the project to ensure the reviewer knows what to expect
The reviewer should be able to delete your thumbnail images and see them recreated when accessing the appropriate endpoints, and then see that they are not being recreated when accessing the same endpoint multiple times.

Before submitting, please check the Project Rubric to confirm that you have met all specifications.
